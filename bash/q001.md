# Bash questions

1. A case where the content of single quotes is interpolated:
```
declare -A MAP=([foo]=bar)
K=foo
echo ${MAP[$K]}
#bar
unset MAP['$K']
echo ${MAP[$K]}
#
```
Note: it works only with unset

2. ANSI-C quotes `$''` and Locale translation quotes `$""`

`$'\tSOMETEXT'` renders `\t` into a tab space before `SOMETEXT`

`$"message"` can translate it into the current locale by `gettext`

Note: curious example: `"\'"` -> `\'`; `$'\''` -> `'`; while `'\''` is invalid

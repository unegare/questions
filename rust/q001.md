# Rust questions

1. `Pin`: Self-referencing struct  
Write a cache decorator for a struct which has an internal search function which is too complex to be called each time. Say, the struct would contain a cache ref-field to the last found element. How to do it properly?
2. `const fn`: loops  
Since loops are forbidden in const functions how to bridge the flaw? (via macro capabilities)  
Task: write a max function for a user defined enum
3. Does Rust's safety guarantee that destructors will always run?
4. Lack of specialisation, `Iterator` is not a generic type. What are drawbacks of implementing the `From` trait specified by an `Iterator` type?  
Note: there is a special trait entitled `FromIterator`. Which usually is not used explicitely, but implicitely by `.collect()`  
Note: the root is in the unstability of the `#![feature!(specialization)]`

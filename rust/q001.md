# Rust questions

1. Pin: Self-referencing struct
Write a cache decorator for a struct which has an internal search function which is too complex to be called each time. Say, the struct would contain a cache ref-field to the last found element. How to do it properly?

2. Const fn: loops
Since loops are forbidden in const functions how to bridge the flaw? (via macro capabilities)
Task: write a max function for a user defined enum

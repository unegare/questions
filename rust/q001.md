# Rust questions

1. `Pin`: Self-referencing struct  
Write a cache decorator for a struct which has an internal search function which is too complex to be called each time. Say, the struct would contain a cache ref-field to the last found element. How to do it properly?
2. `const fn`: loops  
Since loops are forbidden in const functions how to bridge the flaw? (via macro capabilities)  
Task: write a max function for a user defined enum
3. Does Rust's safety guarantee that destructors will always run?
4. Lack of specialisation, `Iterator` is not a generic type. What are drawbacks of implementing the `From` trait specified by an `Iterator` type?  
Note: there is a special trait entitled `FromIterator`. Which usually is not used explicitely, but implicitely by `.collect()`  
Note: the root is in the unstability of the `#![feature!(specialization)]`
5. What Rust built-in type is not FFI compatible?
6. Deref: What would be if the following lines were uncommented?
```
struct MyStruct {
    field: String
}

impl MyStruct {
//    fn vec_func(self: &Vec<Self>) {
//        println!("vec_func");
//    }

    fn box_func(self: &Box<Self>) {
        println!("box_func");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let vms: Vec<MyStruct> = vec![MyStruct { field: "What a mad world!".to_owned() }];
//    vms.func();

    let bms: Box<MyStruct> = Box::new(MyStruct { field: "Hello world!".to_owned()});
    bms.box_func();
}
```
7. Copy: What may be printed out by the following code?
```
#[derive(Debug, Copy)]
struct MyStruct {
    field: u32
}

impl Clone for MyStruct {
    fn clone(&self) -> Self {
        Self {
            field: self.field +1
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let ms0 = MyStruct{field: 0};
    let ms1 = ms0.clone();
    let ms2 = ms1;
    println!("{:?}", ms0);
    println!("{:?}", ms1);
    println!("{:?}", ms2);
}
```

<h1>Rust questions</h1>

<ol>
<li><code>Pin</code>: Self-referencing struct <br />
Write a cache decorator for a struct which has an internal search function which is too complex to be called each time. Say, the struct would contain a cache ref-field to the last found element. How to do it properly?</li>
<li><code>const fn</code>: loops <br />
Since loops are forbidden in const functions how to bridge the flaw? (via macro capabilities) <br />
Task: write a max function for a user defined enum</li>
<li>Does Rust's safety guarantee that destructors will always run?</li>
<li>Lack of specialisation, <code>Iterator</code> is not a generic type. What are drawbacks of implementing the <code>From</code> trait specified by an <code>Iterator</code> type? <br />
Note: there is a special trait entitled <code>FromIterator</code>. Which usually is not used explicitely, but implicitely by <code>.collect()</code> <br />
Note: the root is in the unstability of the <code>#![feature!(specialization)]</code></li>
